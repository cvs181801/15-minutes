15 Minutes is a take on the concept introduced by Andy Warhol "15 Minutes of Fame". This project was built in React and Node.js with Express using the Twitter API.  Find more info on the Twitter API at https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api.

The goal of this project is to encourage the user/viewer to think critically about their use of social media.  Now that we're living in an age when each person can have their 15 minutes, isn't it time to take Andy's excitement about fame a step further?  Instead of simply having your 15 minutes, shouldn't we use that 15 Minutes for something positive?   

I decided to choose 5 celebrities who are frequently using their Twitter platform to send positive messages to their fans.  They are: Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Ashton Kutcher, and Beyonce Knowles. 

Feature Wishlist:
- Create a better user search interface. Currently, the user has to enter the exact Twitter handle (starts with @) for a user in order to find their tweets.  Even one letter off, and it won't pull up the user.  I'd like to design a more flexible search using the GET users/search endpoint, which allows the user to search by multiple criteria.  Find info on this endpoint at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-search
