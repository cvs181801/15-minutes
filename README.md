15 Minutes is a take on the concept introduced by Andy Warhol "15 Minutes of Fame".  I think Andy would have loved all forms of social media, including Twitter.  He was fascinated by celebrities, probably due to the way celebrity itself markets, packages and sells human beings to the public. 

The goal of this project is to encourage the user/viewer to think critically about their use of social media.  Now that we're living in an age when each person can have their 15 minutes of fame, isn't it time to take Andy's excitement about fame a step further?  Instead of simply having your 15 minutes, shouldn't we use that 15 Minutes for something positive?  

I decided to showcase 5 celebrities who are frequently using their Twitter platform to send positive messages to the public:

1. Lady Gaga
2. Oprah Winfrey
3. Reese Witherspoon 
4. Ashton Kutcher
5. Beyonce Knowles

You can also search tweets based on content, or username.
