15 Minutes is a take on the concept introduced by Andy Warhol "15 Minutes of Fame".  I think Andy would have loved all forms of social media, including Twitter.  He was fascinated by celebrities, probably due to the way celebrity itself markets, packages and sells human beings to the public. 

The goal of this project is to encourage the user/viewer to think critically about their use of social media.  Now that we're living in an age when each person can have their 15 minutes, isn't it time to take Andy's excitement about fame a step further?  Instead of simply having your 15 minutes, shouldn't we use that 15 Minutes for something positive?   

I decided to choose 5 celebrities who are frequently using their Twitter platform to send positive messages to their fans.  Here is a list of each:

Gaga.  I think Andy Warhol would have absolutely loved Lady Gaga.  Everything about her screams pop art, and like Andy, she creates deep meaning from objects and actions that would otherwise seem meaningless.  She's taken an active stance in uplifing the LGBTQ community.

Oprah.  Well known for her philanthropy and commitment to positive ideals, Oprah Winfrey was an easy choice for this list.  She has a way of bringing people out of their small bubble of self and helping them think about other's struggles and global issues.  She's constantly helping others stay focused on the positive, and her tweets reflect that.

Reese.  Reese's career has grown from actor to philanthropist.  She frequently posts content empowering and encouraging women in financial and technological advancement.  She's clearly future focused, and I think Andy Warhol would definitely would have taken extra time interviewing her on his show if he were still alive.

Ashton.  Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore founded Thorne together, a non-profit technology company that builds products to end abuse, violence, human trafficking, and eliminate CSAM (child sex abuse content) from the internet.  His active LinkedIn clearly shows his vested interest in using technology to help our most precious citizens: Our children.

Beyonce.  Renowned and beloved in the pop world, Beyonce Knowles' body of artistic work is impressive.  She is clearly a leader in the Black community and can often be found in a creative venture that uplifts Black American's stories, values, and art. You'll find many of her tweets promoting her campaign for charity and social good, BeyGood, which provides information resources to support traditionally marginalized communities, mothers in developing countries, Black business owners, and more.

Wishlist:
- Create a better user search interface. Currently, the user has to enter the exact Twitter handle (starts with @) for a user in order to find their tweets.  Even one letter off, and it won't pull up the user.  I'd like to design a more flexible search using the GET users/search endpoint, which allows the user to search by multiple criteria.  Find info on this endpoint at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/follow-search-get-users/api-reference/get-users-search
